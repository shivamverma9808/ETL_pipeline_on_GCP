# ETL Data Pipeline on GCP | Data Engineering | Cloud Automation ðŸš€

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
An end-to-end **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** built on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for processing and managing large datasets efficiently. Ensures **data quality, scalability, and automated workflow management** for analytics.

## ðŸ›  Features
- ðŸ”¹ **Data Extraction & Transformation:** Cleans and prepares data from multiple sources for analysis.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Data Loading:** Loads transformed data into **BigQuery** for scalable querying and reporting.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Workflow Automation:** Orchestrates ETL workflows using **Cloud Composer (Airflow)** for scheduled execution.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Monitoring & Logging:** Implements error-handling and logging to ensure pipeline reliability.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Cloud Optimization:** Optimized for storage efficiency and cost-effective data processing.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- **Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Cloud Composer, Cloud Functions)  
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Tools:** Airflow, Cloud SDK  

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases
